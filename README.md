# TurbidityPrediction

Comprehensive project for predicting and optimizing turbidity reduction during water treatment using Machine Learning and Optimization Techniques.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting and optimizing the **turbidity reduction** in electrocoagulation-based water treatment systems. Two major versions of the analysis were developed:

- **Version 1:** Initial exploration, cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
- **Version 2:** Enhanced modeling, feature engineering, optimization with Harmony Search, scenario simulation, and Power BI visualization.

Both versions aim to support real-time decision-making for operational settings (Voltage, Time, Number of Electrodes) to achieve efficient water treatment.
